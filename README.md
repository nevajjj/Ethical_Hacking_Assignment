Ethical Hacking: Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing
Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive security assessment of the Metasploitable 2 virtual machine. The project simulates a professional penetration test, moving from initial reconnaissance through to exploitation and post-exploitation analysis.

Objectives
Information Gathering: Identifying open ports, services, and operating system details.

Vulnerability Assessment: Using automated tools and manual research to find weaknesses.

Exploitation: Demonstrating how specific vulnerabilities (like VSFTPD or Samba) can be leveraged to gain access.

Reporting: Documenting findings and providing remediation strategies to secure the system.

Technical Stack & Tools
Target: Metasploitable 2 (Linux-based vulnerable VM)

OS: Kali Linux

Tools Used:

Nmap - Network discovery and port scanning.

Nessus / OpenVAS - Automated vulnerability scanning.

Metasploit Framework - Exploitation and payload delivery.

Searchsploit - Offline exploit database searching.

Methodology
The assessment followed the standard penetration testing lifecycle:

Reconnaissance: Scanning the target for active services.

Analysis: Mapping discovered services to known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).

Exploitation: Gaining unauthorized access via misconfigured services or unpatched software.

Post-Exploitation: Assessing the level of control gained (e.g., Root access).

Disclaimer: This project was conducted in a controlled, isolated lab environment for educational purposes only. Unauthorized hacking is illegal and unethical.
